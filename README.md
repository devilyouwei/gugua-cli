This is the client side of GuGua Network.

To become a peer of the "GuGua P2P Network", please refer to another repo
[GuGua](https://github.com/devilyouwei/gugua)

## Introduction

GuGua is a decentralized social network, it works on blockchain.

A decentralized social network means there is none central server to handle the
user social data.

Or, we can say everyone can be both the server and client in this P2P network!

## Functionalities

Remember, it is just like a twitter on blockchain.

-   Post a moment with pictures, text, videos, music.
-   Comment and reply on the posts.
-   Transfer crypto currency with each other.
-   Make your moment an NFT and sell or present to others.
-   Connect or disconnect with other users through blockchain smart contract.
-   Bind your crypto wallets such as BTC,ETH,BNB to easily manage your different
    kinds of crypto currency.
-   Validate posts, users, report of illegal information to get "gugua tokens"
    as rewards (Mining)
-   Verify or to be verified as well-known accounts, such as famous stars,
    institutions.
-   ...need to implement

## Some Mechanisms

Validation of a new registered account needs proof of work to get rewards.

Validation of a post content needs proof of stake to get rewards.

As more users sign up in the network, there are fewer rewards to validators (the
miners).

We take "reward halving by user increment" instead of **Bitcoin's** reward
halving by time.
